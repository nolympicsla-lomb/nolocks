## Airbnb is taking over our cities.
Corporate-run, illegal, and speculative 'home-share' hotels contribute to rising rents, evictions, and homelessness. Across the city, hundreds of tenants have been kicked out of their homes after profit-eying landlords raised rents higher than what the average family can afford to pay.

Once these units, or even full buildings, have been cleared out, landlords can convert them into hotels. When there are fewer homes to rent out, landlords then raise the rents on their remaining units, overburdening some of their tenants and displacing others.

## Think this should be illegal? It is.
Short term leases in units that are not a leaser's primary residence have been banned since July 2019 in Los Angeles. But Airbnb does little to enforce these ordinances on their own platform, and LA law enforcement does even less.
