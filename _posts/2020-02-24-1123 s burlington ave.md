**Story**
this has been an airbnb for over a year. i believe there were tenants evicted from this in the past but not totally clear on that. there are film shoots here often. it's owned by a property management company based in fairfax area but the host is a "Marni Lustig" who goes by "Angel BnB" on the site.
