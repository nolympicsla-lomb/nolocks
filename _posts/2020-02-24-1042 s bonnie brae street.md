**Address**
1042 S Bonnie Brae St, Los Angeles, CA

**Story**
my friends live on this street and are seeing more airbnbs surround them. this couple seems to be renting multiple rooms in their house each for about $1k/month, as well as listing the units on AirBNB. 
ironically they have this "story booth" on their private website with a question about "what does home mean to you?"
