**Address**
1647 Cortez St, Los Angeles, CA

**Story**
Previously a rent-stabilized duplex turned flip into a single family residence. The original owner tried to rush the renters to leave without proper process / rights. Became a full antagonistic "Ellis eviction" process, where the owner removed  amenities like the washer and dryer to punish the renters.  
Now the second unit is illegally airbnb'ed by the current owner for 'flexibility'
